	I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>

	<blockquote>
	Passing cars,<br>
	 when you can't see,<br>
	 may get you,<br>
	 A glimpse,<br>
	 of eternity.<br>
</blockquote>

	<p> I definitely won't be passing any cars.

<p> My first day of trip! I can't belive I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I am on a Segway. I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: </p> 
<ul>
<li>Cell Phone,</li>
<li>Ipod,</li>
<li>digital camera,</li>
<li>and a protein bar.</li>
</ul>
<p> Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A jorney of thousand miles begins with one segway<q>
